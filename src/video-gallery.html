              Pia was an engaging and inspirational speaker.
              The presentation provided guidance on how to start sustainable transformation within the company:
              it was very focused on the 'how' and the lesson learned through the process.

              I had the great privilege growing up in Muir Beach, CA.
              I spent my childhood in the forest and on the trails and playing in the tide pools.
              If we don't make a really radical shift in our relationship to natural resources I'm not going to be able to do those things with my grandchildren.

              The event went really well and Steve was great, so well received. His presentation was great,
              and to stand up for 45 minutes with no slides or notes isn't easy!
              Please pass on my thanks and appreciation to him.

              Fewer of them, used in a 'purer' form and designed for reuse from the beginning.
